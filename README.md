# Income Calculator for Potential Airbnb Hosts in New York City
This project is the M.A. Statistics Capstone Project at the University of California, Berkeley.

- Developed a predictive model for estimating the yearly revenue of Airbnb listings in New York City. The model achieved an error margin of 5% and was based on housing demand market research and machine learning techniques for pricing and booking rate prediction.

- Implemented a variable selection procedure that combined regularization and bootstrapping techniques. This procedure improved the robustness of the pricing model, allowing for more accurate revenue predictions.

- Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically sentiment analysis, on guest reviews. This analysis significantly improved the accuracy of the occupancy model by 40%.
